The goal of this talk is to help developers interested in F# (strongly-typed functional 
first language for .NET Runtime/JS) how to start, by showing the rich tooling built by 
opensource community. Once removed the friction of a new ecosystem is easier to evaluate 
the F# features

It will be shown some common scenarios for devs: from zero to a new web/console app, 
how to add dependancies, build it, debug it, test it and xplat deployment options to target
 os or docker. The tools used will be cross platform (VSCode, .NET Core Sdk) and open source.
